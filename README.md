# Weather_Forecasting_System

This project presents a Weather Forecasting Web Application that leverages machine learning models and real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver accurate and dynamic weather predictions. The application is built using Flask for the backend and incorporates user-friendly frontend interfaces, offering real-time insights into current and hourly weather conditions.

The system accepts a city name as input and fetches live weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure via API requests. These features are then fed into a pre-trained machine learning model to generate custom weather predictions, providing users with enhanced weather intelligence beyond standard forecasts.
